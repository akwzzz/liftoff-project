This is a project for people who are trying to track how the foods they eat impact their well-being. It will be designed to track diet, exercise, sleep, mood, and general wellbeing. User inputs will include what foods and supplements a user is ingesting, and amount of sleep and exercise. Scale ratings will be selected for how the user is feeling overall. Data will then translate into graphs correlating the foods you eat to how you feel. Ideally, this program could be used to track food intolerance/allergic reactions, as well as effects of certain activities (exercise, sleep habits) or effects of other substances (coffee, energy drinks, alcohol, supplements).
